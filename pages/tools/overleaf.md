## Framing

LaTeX is a typesetting system that can be used to write academic papers and create professional-looking documents. Users type in plain text format, but mark up the text with tagging conventions, and the nicely-formatted result is shown in an output file.
LaTeX has many benefits including typesetting complicated facets of research such as mathematical notation, creating reusable bibliographies, and creating figures and diagrams among many others.

 Overleaf is an online platform that can be used to create and edit LaTeX documents. You can share and simultaneously edit documents with collaborators, similar to the way you collaborate on a Google Doc.
