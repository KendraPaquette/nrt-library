## What is TOPIC-NAME?

Papaja is short for ‘preparing APA journal articles’ and is designed to create fully reproducible journal articles that seamlessly fuse statistical analyses, simulations, and prose. A manuscript written with papaja can be thought of as an extensively commented analysis script ready for publication in a scientific journal. - From Frederik Aust & Marius Barth in [Papaja](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/introduction.html)
