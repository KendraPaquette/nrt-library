## What is TOPIC-NAME?

Brief description.


## Recommended Path for Learning

* This 11 minute video explains both continuous and discrete system state space models, how to derive the model from equations (linear or nonlinear).

* Website from MATLAB’s help center; Gives light overview of what a state space model is and relationships between discrete and continuous matrices. [What Are State-Space Models?](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ident/ug/what-are-state-space-models.html)

* This set of slides/notes from a course at MIT includes information of what state-space systems and models are, as well as code examples.

## Book
[Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering) This book gives a great overview of dynamical modeling and phase space conceptualization. It is an entire book, but I can’t even decide on which chapters are best because it is so foundational. There is also an associated video series of class lectures by the author: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycJEoqmQvwg
