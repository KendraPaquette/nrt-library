## What is TOPIC-NAME?

Brief description.


## Recommended Path for Learning

* [Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Made Fast and Easy with Dr. Ray Fox](<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_QjJry0hTc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>) This 20 minutes video is a great introduction to this concept.  

* [The Promise of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://thegradient.pub/the-promise-of-hierarchical-reinforcement-learning/) This is great blog post that explains hierarchical reinforcement learning using real-world examples to help explain and clarify the hierarchical problem-solving approach.  

* [Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning - Diona Precup](<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8b0yC6COJ8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>_) This video explains Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in a very straightforward way using an every daily example. This talk presents the concept of  Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning without the technical aspect.


## Further Learning

## Applied papers 

* [Video Captioning via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Wang_Video_Captioning_via_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) This paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for video captioning.


## Online tutorials

* [Predictive knowledge acquisition via hierarchical reinforcement learning](https://github.com/konichuvak/pandemonium) Predictive knowledge acquisition via hierarchical reinforcement learning. This github library uses python code and provides implementations for agents that seek to learn about their environment by predicting multiple signals from a single stream of experience.

* [Hierarchical Reinforcement](https://paperswithcode.com/task/hierarchical-reinforcement-learning) This link includes papers with code. 

## Theory papers 
* [Hierarchical reinforcement learning and decision making](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959438812000876) This paper by Matthew Botvinick discusses hierarchical reinforcement learning in neuroscience.
