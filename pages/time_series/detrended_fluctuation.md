## Applied papers 

* Paper comparing "i) Pearson’s coefficient to investigate linear correlations; ii) Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to compare distributions; and iii) detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to quantify auto–correlations” in written text. [Robustness of sentence length measures in written texts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437118305326)

* This science brief from the APA covers many different approaches to the study of human behavior. It succinctly defines different methods and approaches.

## Online tutorials

* This article provides a walkthrough of MFDFA in Matlab. It includes an external link to downloadable code to follow along with the tutorial (https://www.ntnu.edu/inb/geri/software). [Introduction to multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis in Matlab](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2012.00141/full)

* This repo covers time series preparation for sound data, as well as documented code for running DFA. [‘nonlinear-natural-noisy’ GitHub repository by mchiovaro](https://github.com/mchiovaro/nonlinear-natural-noisy)


## Theory paper
* This book was written by the pioneers of nonlinear methods as applied to the behavioral sciences. It gives succinct definitions, explanation, and demonstration of methods through examples.
