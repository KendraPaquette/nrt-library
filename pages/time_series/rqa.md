## What is TOPIC-NAME?

Brief description.


## Recommended Path for Learning

* This book was written by the pioneers of nonlinear methods as applied to the behavioral sciences. It gives succinct definitions, explanation, and demonstration of methods through examples.
[Tutorials in contemporary nonlinear methods for the behavioral sciences](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2005/nsf05057/nmbs/nmbs.pdf)

* This article provides an overview of the use of nonlinear methods in social and personality psychology. It gives a good overview of the conceptual underpinnings of recurrence analysis and provides a comparison to other dynamical methods. [Complex Dynamical Systems in Social and Personality Psychology](http://cognaction.org/rdmaterials/php.cv/pdfs/incollection/richardson_dale_marsh_proofs.pdf)

* This science brief from the APA covers many different approaches to the study of human behavior. It succinctly defines different methods and approaches for comparison.

## Further Learning

## Video

* A webinar tutorial hosted by the APA on using CRQA with a focus on cognitive science. Based on the paper: Knight, A. P., Kennedy, D. M., & McComb, S. A. (2016). Using recurrence analysis to examine group dynamics. Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 20, 223-241. It also gives a walkthrough of some of the code in R.

* This is a video of a PowerPoint presentation introducing RQA, including theoretical background, definitions of RQA measures, and examples of using RQA in R. It is quite long (almost 60 minutes) and provides a bit more detail than necessary for getting started with RQA.

## Applied papers 

* This paper provides a practical, hands-on introduction to cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA), diagonal cross-recurrence profiles (DCRP), and multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis (MdRQA) in R. The paper provides readers with a conceptual introduction and a step-by-step explanation on how the analyses are performed in R with a summary of the current best practices of their application.

## Useful Resources and Online Tutorials

* This website defines all measures associated with RQA. Beyond that, it does not provide much information, but it is a helpful reference when first learning RQA or refreshing yourself on what each of the measures represents.
[Cross Recurrence Measures](https://rdrr.io/cran/crqa/man/crqa.html)

* This repo covers time series preparation for sound data, as well as documented code for running RQA across a large time series. [‘nonlinear-natural-noisy’ GitHub repository by mchiovaro](https://github.com/mchiovaro/nonlinear-natural-noisy)

* This repo covers continuous CRQA and includes practice data to use with the code. [crqa-tool repository on GitHub by a-paxton](https://github.com/a-paxton/crqa-tools/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-continuous_recurrence.R)
