## What is Machine Translation?

Machine Translation is the automated process of converting a source text from one language to another. It provides a cheaper option compared to a human translator if you need a rough translation. However, as machine translation techniques advance, the integrity of the translations increases. This technique can help researchers comb through documents in foreign languages to extract important information and get a basic understanding of the content.

* If you are interested in using some Machine Translation, check out the state-of-the-art repository OpenNMT. Resources and a codebase for both TensorFlow and PyTorch are maintained. [OpenNMT](https://opennmt.net/)

* Machine Translation is a huge field with many approaches. If you are looking for more information, consider starting with this literature review that will introduce you to many topics and provide references for further reading: [Machine Translation: A Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01122)
