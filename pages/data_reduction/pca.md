## Framing

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of datasets with multiple variables. The main goal of PCA is to transform large sets of variables into smaller sets of “principal components” while preserving as much information as possible. PCA produces as many principal components as there are variables. Only principal components that explain the most variance in the data set are retained, while those with low explanatory value are discarded.
