* GitHub repo with tutorials for creating image classifiers using increasing model complexity. [Code tutorials for image classification using pytorch](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification)

* Article describing the current state of CNNs. [Scholarly article for CNN and image classification](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/neco_a_00990)

## Further Learning

## Online tutorials

* Websites for Pytorch and TensorFlow have great tutorials for using the libraries as well as descriptions for how to use each method. [TensorFlow and Pytorch websites](https://pytorch.org/)
