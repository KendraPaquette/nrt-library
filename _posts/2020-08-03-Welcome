Welcome! 

We are so excited to launch this new website that is intended to help scientists studying human behavior to understand and apply new methods, concepts, and techniques from machine-learning, AI, and other computational fields. Many online data-science resources target workers in industry, programmers, and other communities with extensive technical expertise. This library curates resources useful to those who study cognition, perception, action, language, neuroscience, social interactions, and other aspects of human behavior.

We invite you to explore, learn and contribute to this site. 

Please look atÂ [SVM](https://nrt-library.github.io/nrt-library/support_vector_machines.html)Â orÂ [Jupyter Notebooks](https://nrt-library.github.io/nrt-library/jupyter.html)Â for examples of content for data science resources that we are looking for. As you can see on theÂ [Table of Topics](https://nrt-library.github.io/nrt-library/mydoc_topics.html), we added an ðŸ†˜ icon for topics that need your help! The guide for how to edit content is here:Â [Contribution Guidelines](https://nrt-library.github.io/nrt-library/mydoc_guides.html).
