## About

The NRT Library for Data Science and Human Behavior is a community-maintained resource to help scientists studying human behavior to understand and apply new methods, concepts, and techniques from machine-learning, AI, and other computational fields. Many online data-science resources target workers in industry, programmers, and other communities with extensive technical expertise. This library curates resources useful to those who study cognition, perception, action, language, neuroscience, social interactions, and other aspects of human behavior.

## How to navigate this website

There are two navigation bars on the left panel of the website. The one **at the top** allows you to navigate subtopics within a larger topic or section. The one **at the bottom** (**Table of Contents**) allows you to navigate the contents within a page (i.e., within a subtopic). For instance: [Natural Language Processing](nlp_landing_page) is a section with several subtopics like [Sentiment Analysis](sentiment_analysis) and [Semantic Vectors](semantic_vectors). The tree structure looks like this:

[Natural Language Processing](nlp_landing_page):  
    - [Sentiment Analysis](sentiment_analysis)  
    - [Semantic Vectors](semantic_vectors)

Once you select a subtopic, you will see that the **Table of Contents** sidebar will display the contents within that subtopic.

## Library topics

The full and growing list of topics can be found in the [Table of Topics](mydoc_topics.html) section in the sidebar and in the `Topics` drop-down menu tab in the top navigation bar.
